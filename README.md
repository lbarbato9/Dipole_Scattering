# Dipole Scattering

Ultra-High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (UHF MRI) refers to MRI systems
operating at magnetic field strengths of 7 Tesla and above. In particular, UHF-MRI
provides SNR values higher than those obtained in typical 3T and 1.5T MRI.
Despite this MRI-UFH also brings along some challenging issues that need to be
addressed. The main disadvantages are the field inhomogeneity due to comparable
wavelengths with tissue sizes and an increase in SAR. For general solving of such kind
of issues, very expensive and computationally complex hardware is used, which limits
the large-scale development.
High-permittivity materials represent a great alternative; in fact, the obtained re-
sults have been excellent.To predict the permittivity value that maximizes the field
within the subject being examined, a new analytical electromagnetic model of scattering in spherical geometry is developed, which allows replacing the traditional numerical
model.
The new model provides the evaluation of the field inside a multi-layer sphere,
representing a fast tool that allow to make prediction before considering experiment on
the human tissue directly.
Generally, the field in MRI is irradiated by coils, which can provide very good results
at low field intensities. It is even possible to increase the SNR simply by increasing the
number of loops. However, when the intensities reach 7T or more, this cannot be done,
since in that case the increase in loops does not influence the SNR.
Electric dipoles, on the other hand, can be an interesting solution to explore,especially
with high frequencies. That is why the analytical model has been implemented so far
considering the field irradiated by electric dipoles
